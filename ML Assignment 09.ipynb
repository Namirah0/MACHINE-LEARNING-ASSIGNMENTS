    "1. What is feature engineering, and how does it work? Explain the various aspects of feature engineering in depth.\n",
    "Ans: Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in\n",
    "    supervised learning. In order to make machine learning work well on new tasks, it might be necessary to design and train\n",
    "    better features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering in ML consists of four main steps: Feature Creation, Transformations, Feature Extraction, and Feature \n",
    "    Selection. Feature engineering consists of creation, transformation, extraction, and selection of features, also known as \n",
    "    variables, that are most conducive to creating an accurate ML algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a look at some Feature Engineering Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation: Imputation deals with handling missing values in data.\n",
    "Discretization/Binning: Discretization involves essentially taking a set of values of data and grouping sets of them together \n",
    "    in some logical fashion into bins (or buckets).\n",
    "Caategorical Encoding: Categorical encoding is the technique used to encode categorical features into numerical values which \n",
    "    are usually simpler for an algorithm to understand. One hot encoding(OHE) is a popularly used technique of categorical \n",
    "    encoding. Here, categorical values are converted into simple numerical 1’s and 0’s without the loss of information.\n",
    "Feature Splitting: Splitting features into parts can sometimes improve the value of the features toward the target to be \n",
    "    learned. For instance, Date might better contribute to the target function than Date and Time.\n",
    "Handling Outliers: Outliers are unusually high or low values in the dataset which are unlikely to occur in normal scenarios. \n",
    "    Since these outliers could adversely affect your prediction they must be handled appropriately. The various methods of \n",
    "    handling outliers include:\n",
    "    a) Removal: The records containing outliers are removed from the distribution. However, the presence of outliers over \n",
    "    multiple variables could result in losing out on a large portion of the datasheet with this method. b) Replacing \n",
    "    values: The outliers could alternatively bed treated as missing values and replaced by using appropriate imputation.\n",
    "    c) Capping: Capping the maximum and minimum values and replacing them with an arbitrary value or a value from a \n",
    "    variable distribution. d) Discretization 6. Scaling: Feature scaling is done owing to the sensitivity of \n",
    "    some machine learning algorithms to the scale of the input values. This technique of feature scaling is\n",
    "    sometimes referred to as feature normalization. The commonly used processes of scaling include: \n",
    "    a) Min-Max Scaling: This process involves the rescaling of all values in a feature in the range 0 \n",
    "    to 1. In other words, the minimum value in the original range will take the value 0, the \n",
    "    maximum value will take 1 and the rest of the values in between the two extremes will be \n",
    "    appropriately scaled. b) Standardization/Variance scaling: All the data points are subtracted \n",
    "    by their mean and the result divided by the distribution's variance to arrive at a \n",
    "    distribution with a 0 mean and variance of 1. 7. Variable Transformation: Variable \n",
    "    transformation techniques could help with normalizing skewed data. One such popularly \n",
    "    used transformation is the logarithmic transformation. Logarithmic transformations operate to compress the larger numbers \n",
    "    and relatively expand the smaller numbers. This in turn results in less skewed values especially in the case of heavy-tailed\n",
    "    distributions. Other variable transformations used include Square root transformation and Box cox transformation which is a \n",
    "    generalization of the former two. 8. Feature Creation: Feature creation involves deriving new features from existing ones. \n",
    "    This can be done by simple mathematical operations such as aggregations to obtain the mean, median, mode, sum, or \n",
    "    difference and even product of two values. These features, although derived directly from the given data, when \n",
    "    carefully chosen to relate to the target can have an impact on the performance"
