    "    combinations of the earlier selected feature with all other remaining features. Again select the feature with the minimum \n",
    "    p-value. Now fit a model with three features by trying combinations of two previously selected features with other \n",
    "    remaining features. Repeat this process until we have a set of selected features with a p-value of individual features less \n",

    "    then remove the insignificant feature with the highest p-value(> significance level). This process repeats again and again\n",
